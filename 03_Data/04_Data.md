Power BI can import data from various file types and databases, supporting both local and cloud sources.

Summary:
## Flat Files:
 - Flat files (like .csv, .txt, and fixed width files) contain a single data table with a uniform structure and no hierarchies.
 - Excel files (.xlsx) are also commonly used.
 - Power BI Desktop can import data from these files using the Get data feature.
## File Locations:
 - Local: Importing from a local file creates a new semantic model in Power BI; changes to the original file are not reflected.
 - OneDrive for Business/Personal & SharePoint: These cloud options keep your Power BI data, reports, and dashboards synchronized with the source file.
## Import Process:
 a. Use Get data in Power BI Desktop and select the file type (e.g., Excel).
 b. Select the tables/entities to import in the Navigator window.
 c. Choose Load to import directly or Transform Data to clean data first.
## Changing Data Source:
 - You can update file paths or database connections in Power BI if the source location changes.
 - Ensure the file structure remains the same to avoid breaking your reports.
## Relational Databases:
 - Power BI can connect directly to databases (e.g., SQL Server) using Get data.
 - You can import data by selecting tables or by writing custom SQL queries to filter and select specific data.
 - Always use specific columns and rows in SQL queries to optimize performance and avoid unnecessary data.
## Best Practices:
 - Use cloud storage for files that change regularly to keep Power BI in sync.
 - Use SQL queries or database views to limit and optimize the data imported into Power BI.
 - Avoid using SELECT * in SQL queries to prevent importing unnecessary columns.

Power BIâ€™s flexibility with data sources and import methods makes it a powerful tool for building up-to-date, efficient reports and dashboards.
