Your Answer

Correct Answer/Explanation

Prescriptive analytics = “what happened”

Descriptive analytics answers “what has happened.” Prescriptive recommends actions to achieve a goal.

Data analyst builds data warehouses

Data engineers set up and manage data platforms, not data analysts.

Data analyst sets up platforms

Data engineers are responsible for infrastructure and data platforms.

Predictive analytics = recommends actions

Predictive forecasts trends; prescriptive analytics recommends actions.

Prescriptive analytics uses ML

AI (Artificial Intelligence) primarily uses machine learning for insights with minimal human input.

Analytics engineer = capturing trusted data

Analytics engineers curate, model, and ensure quality of data for analysis and reporting.

Tips for Studying
	•	Memorize the five analytics types and what questions they answer.
	•	Understand the key differences between data roles, especially between data analyst, data engineer, and analytics engineer.
	•	Practice matching analytics types to business scenarios.
	•	Review responsibilities for each role and the tools they use.
	•	Remember: Trusted data is essential for accurate, reliable insights and confident decision-making.

Example Scenario

A retail business uses descriptive analytics to review last year’s sales. They notice a spike in sales for a product (diagnostic analytics investigates why). Predictive analytics forecasts if the trend will continue, and prescriptive analytics suggests how much to stock. AI tools might automate the analysis and provide instant insights.

Focus on understanding each analytics type’s question, the responsibilities of each data role, and the importance of data trust and quality.
