Prepare
	•	Definition: The process of profiling, cleaning, and transforming raw data to make it trusted and understandable for analysis.
	•	Key Points:
	▫	Ensures data integrity and accuracy.
	▫	Involves connecting to data sources and considering performance.
	▫	Addresses privacy and security (anonymization, removing sensitive data).
	▫	Lays the foundation for reliable reports and insights.
	▫	Often the most time-consuming step.

Model
	•	Definition: Determining how tables relate to each other by defining relationships, metrics, and calculations.
	•	Key Points:
	▫	Builds semantic models for accurate and efficient reporting.
	▫	Enhances data by adding custom calculations and metrics.
	▫	Directly impacts report performance and accuracy.
	▫	Iterative process with data preparation.
	▫	Poor modeling can lead to slow or inaccurate reports.

Visualize
	•	Definition: Creating reports and dashboards that bring data to life using appropriate visualizations and interactions.
	•	Key Points:
	▫	Tells a compelling story to solve business problems.
	▫	Helps decision makers quickly gain needed insights.
	▫	Should focus on necessary data points for clarity.
	▫	Incorporates AI features (AI visuals, Copilot, Quick Insights).
	▫	Accessibility in design is crucial.

Analyze
	•	Definition: Understanding and interpreting information from reports to find insights, patterns, trends, and make predictions.
	•	Key Points:
	▫	Uses Power BI’s analytical capabilities.
	▫	Identifies actionable insights and supports decision-making.
	▫	Advanced analytics (trends, predictions, behaviors).
	▫	AI integrations (Azure ML, cognitive services) enhance analysis.
	▫	Makes complex analysis accessible to more users.

Manage
	•	Definition: Overseeing Power BI assets (reports, dashboards, workspaces, models) to ensure secure sharing, collaboration, and trust.
	•	Key Points:
	▫	Shares and distributes content securely.
	▫	Reduces data silos and duplication.
	▫	Encourages collaboration and content discovery.
	▫	Uses apps for large audience management and navigation.
	▫	Endorses certified semantic models for trusted data.
